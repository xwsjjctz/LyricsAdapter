/**
 * Player Controller (Phase 1 of the refactor roadmap).
 *
 * Owns playback *intent* orchestration that previously lived in AppWorkspace:
 * cross-slot selection, search-result navigation, online stream play and
 * playlist play. It does NOT own the <audio> lifecycle, URL resolution, or
 * error recovery — those stay in usePlayback.
 *
 * Migration policy (roadmap Rule 1): logic is moved here verbatim from
 * AppWorkspace, not redesigned. Dep arrays are reproduced exactly to avoid
 * accidental behaviour changes; any known dep-array gaps are recorded in
 * docs/refactor-backlog.md rather than fixed here.
